Project 3 Python Class   
Here are following requirements to completing Menu shapes:

  1. Create a “MENU” with 4 - 5 options have the user click the option and thereafter ask the user to enter the amount of stars from 1 - 50. From there your “for loop” will create the shape.

                    1. Filled Triangle  

                    2. filled Square

                    3. This can be any shape such as a Square, circle, a different angle of the triangle…etc

                   4 . Bow Tie shape (extra credit)

                   5. Exit 

     I will need the following requirements:

                       a. case statements for each menu option 1,2,3,4,(5)

                       b. either do/while, while loop, or for loop   

                       c. each shape should have it own function

                       d. if/else statement or try/catch statements for error message.
